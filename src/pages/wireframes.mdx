<MethodSectionWhatIs method={currentMethod} title="What are wireframes?">
  <p>
    Wireframes are rough sketches of an interface that are often used in
    discussions with stakeholders to communicate functionality and to rapidly
    encourage ideation and iteration. They also help with understanding the
    requirements at a deeper level, as it helps uncover edge cases. They do not
    focus on the visual style of the product, and instead, communicate the
    layout and on-screen elements in the form of simple shapes and placeholder
    text. Designers may also write directly on the wireframe to communicate
    functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    When used properly, they can save countless hours of fully designing an
    interface just to find out they got the functionality wrong and have to
    start again. Wireframes are considered a “low-fidelity” design.

  title="How do you create wireframes?"
>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1: Understand the goals and requirements</h3>
      Are you trying to design a new checkout system? Are you trying to get them
      to the checkout page in fewer steps? Understanding the requirements of the
      feature will allow you to create proper user tasks in step 2.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 2: Create a task that the user should complete</h3>
      Now that you understand what your requirements, create a user task. This is
      a goal for the user to accomplish on your site or within your product, and
      should be broken down into the ideal and simplest steps the user will take.
      These ideal steps are also known as “the happy path”.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 3: Create a wireframe of the user’s starting point</h3>
      Once you have the task and happy path defined, you can start wireframing. You
      should start at the very first step in their task. Sketch out the interface
      of the page they will be looking at during the first step.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 4: Create a wireframe for each step in the user task</h3>
      Next, create a wireframe for each step in the happy path until the end of the
      task. You can use text to explain functionality, and arrows to show movement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 5: Create wireframes for any secondary or additional steps</h3>
      These are interactions outside of the happy path, and are important to wireframe
      as it can help you understand the implications of your design at a deeper level.
      You may catch things in this step that will force you to change the functionality
      in your happy path.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 6: Create another set of wireframes</h3>
      You should now be done your first iteration of your wireframes. Now you should
      set your set of wireframes aside and address the functionality in a different
      way. Try presenting everything differently. Go a little crazy! Now is the time
      to experiment, as it costs next to nothing and could result in some new and
      exciting ways to accomplish the same task. It also gives you more to discuss
      when you review them with your stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 7: Continue creating different sets of wireframes</h3>
      Continue crafting different sets of wireframes until you run out of ideas,
      or run out of time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 8: Review them all</h3>
      It’s important to show all of your sets of wireframes because it allows the
      group to focus on the good parts of each set, and you are less likely to get
      attached to your designs if you only presented one.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 9: Reiterate</h3>
      Take the feedback, and reiterate your wireframes, consolidating them into one
      final version. At this point, you may have time for another review, or you
      may be in a good position to throw them into a digital prototype and run some
      usability tests on them with actual users.
    </li>
  </ol>

<MethodSectionTips method={currentMethod} title="Tips for great wireframes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Get others involved at the wireframing level. Conduct a design session
      where you and your team spend 3 minutes sketching out wireframes for each
      requirement, then discuss them after each round. This will help you
      generate new ideas and ways of addressing the functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some companies may use different terms for wireframes, or may confuse them
      for mockups or prototypes. Make sure you understand their terminology
      before starting any work on your wireframes.
