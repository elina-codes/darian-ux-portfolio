  <p>
    Developed at <a href="http://athinkingape.com/" target="blanl">A Thinking Ape</a>, Perfect Drift was an Android game where you had to <strong>win street races to gain and maintain turf dominance.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>The problem</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>This game was extremely far behind schedule</strong> as it had switched Lead Designers twice before. A lot of money was being sunk into this, and designs kept getting reworked, with no end
    in sight.
  </p>

  <h3>My role</h3>
  <p>
    Assisting the founders (who were now the Lead Designers) <strong>to get their project back on track.</strong> I prototyped new mechanics, created interfaces, communicated the vision to the team, and made sure everyone had what they needed in order to continue their tasks.

  <p>
    When I joined this project, the game was well into production, however the Lead Designer wanted to redesign the core mechanics (again).
    Since I have a lot of experience with prototyping, <strong>we locked ourselves in a room for a week and, under my lead, prototyped some games on paper</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Here you can see a few images of some of the paper prototypes for the boost mechanic, as well as a video of us trying it out.

  <p>
    After ironing out the details on the mechanics, <strong>we created a high-fidelity prototype and went through several iterations of the mechanics</strong> and prototyping phases until we got consistent, positive feedback.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Here you can see a few videos of the different iterations of our core mechanics.

  <p>
    Once the core mechanics were finally done and back on track, <strong>I also helped out by balancing some sections in the game</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Here you can view a few example spreadsheets</strong>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xtm86kl4V6EijdbjOwm6kRaNwjTR00zzqN8BhJs1c_0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This first one</a> contains the list of prices for all of the parts that the player can buy or get in game, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IRjatbo9LR_mlZyGWCRSONWXNEm_bnogCyVXhIzwhI0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this other one</a> is a snippet from our drops/loot system, which sets the chances that the player can get a specific type of crate as a reward.

  <p>
    Throughout the entire production cycle of Perfect Drift, the vision changed so frequently that there was a lot of reiteration for all of the screens. This was challenging as I was one of only two on the team that worked on the UI.
  </p>

  <p>
    To show you the amount of work we did due to the constant iterations, <strong>here you can see an image that shows you every single screen in the game <a href={require("../images/work/perfect-drift-07.jpg")} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(full image here)</a>, and I have added a second image which shows every single version of only one of those screens that we went through <a href={require("../images/work/perfect-drift-08.jpg")} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(full image here)</a></strong>.

<NextSteps title="Outcome">
  <p>
    In terms of this game hitting its targets for the company, <strong>this game was the most epic of fails. Really. But I learned a lot about what not to do with a product</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main thing was that you can't spend all of your time constantly reiterating designs based on opinion for a full year until it's
    ready to go live. You need constant testing, every step of the way, with your target audience. Not only could that have saved this game
    from being a disaster, but it could have kept the team morale up, as they would be getting feedback on their hard work much earlier on.
