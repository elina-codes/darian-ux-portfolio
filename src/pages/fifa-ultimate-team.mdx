    This is <strong>the first FIFA Ultimate Team DLC package that I worked on at <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Arts Canada</a> as a UX and Game Designer</strong>, though the game was originally launched in 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the game mode was picking up a lot of good momentum, <strong>my main task was to design the supporting Web App for the game</strong>, as well as some minor in-game features like the leaderboards system.
  </p>
  <p>Below are my examples from this project.</p>

  <p>
    By FIFA Ultimate Team 11, it was in its third year of production, but this was the first
    year it was getting a supporting web app.
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>
    My tasks were to transfer the selected features and functionality from the
    console version over to the web app
  </strong>
  . I would create the functionality with wireframes, then work closely with the
  IDs to create the mockups.
</p>

<p><strong>Here you can see a wireframe next to the final outcome.</strong></p>

  <p>
    On the console side, the leaderboards were a pretty simple task and a good
    introduction to the world of FIFA Ultimate Team.{" "}
    <strong>
      I created the functionality, flow and wireframes for the screens, then
      worked with an UI Designer to produce the final mockups.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Though I've lost the wireframes,{" "}
    <strong>
      here you can see the final mockup of the leaderboards feature.

    When we released the web app,{" "}
    <strong>
      the amount of trading increased by 8x, almost overnight, and purchases
      with in-game currency almost went up by a factor of 3
    </strong>{" "}
    when measuring web app users vs console-only users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though I don't quite remember the outcome of the leaderboards,{" "}
    <strong>
      it's also interesting to note that the leaderboards are still in FIFA
      Ultimate Team 17, with nearly identical functionality,
    </strong>{" "}
    just styled differently.

  <p>
    <strong>
      This year, my jobs were to redesign the New Items flow to be more
      intuitive, increase fun and engagement wherever possible, and incorporate
      best UX practices on all new designs.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Below are some examples of my work on this project.</p>

<p>
  From the user information gathered from the marketing and data teams, <strong>I came up with an initial design for the New Items flow. I then gathered feedback from our usability tests</strong> with the wireframes, then worked with the Interface Designers to create proper mockups.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Here you can see an image of the original paper prototype and a video from one of our final paper prototype sessions.</strong> In this video, you can see how I conduct my sessions; giving them a task scenario, and then
  unbiasedly prompting them to speak their mind to ensure I get the best and most accurate
  feedback from them.

      after several reiterations based off of feedback from our tests.
    </strong>{" "}
    I've also uploaded a video that a fan made, showing you all of the
    interactions and full experience of the New Items flow, to give you an idea
    of the depth of this design.
  </p>

<NextSteps title="Outcome" subtitle="FIFA Ultimate Team 12">
  <p>
    The updated New Items flow resulted in overall{" "}
    <strong>
      less time spent on this screen. Though that may sound like a bad thing, it
      was actually good. It meant our players could manage their new items much
      faster and get back to playing the game or buying more packs of cards.
    </strong>{" "}
    This was also a huge win for prototyping at the company, as it got a lot of
    attention from upper management and other product managers at the company.

    <strong>
      From last year's game, we noticed that there was a 40% dropoff after the
      very first screen, so this year, I created an extremely powerful new
      introduction flow for our users to address that.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Below are some examples of my work on this project.</p>

<WorkSection
  title="Lots of prototyping!" subtitle="FIFA Ultimate 13"

<p>
  Since the game had solid mechanics and was generating good revenue, we had to tackle the
  issue of this dropoff.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>I ran extensive usability tests on this new introduction flow</strong>{" "}
  throughout the whole pre-production and production phases of this project,
  which went through several iterations.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
      Here you can watch a fan made video of their first introduction to FIFA Ultimate Team,
      using the onboarding flow I designed.
  </strong> You can also view the <a href={require("../images/work/fifa-ultimate-team-13-03.jpg")} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> master image of all of the screens used for the first prototype here</a>.

<p>
  The introduction flow was the majority of my time, but <strong>I still worked on several other screens in the game to improve their functionality.
  </strong> This Team of the Week Challenge feature was new to the game this year and required work from
  the ground up.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Here you can see one of my original wireframes and the final mockup for the Team of the Week Challenge.</strong> You can also see <a href={require("../images/work/fifa-ultimate-team-13-06.jpg")} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another wireframe and final mockup here.</a>

  <p>
    FIFA Ultimate Team 13 was a huge success.{" "}
    <strong>
      The new onboarding flow closed the day 1 retention gap by 45%, and the day
      2 retention gap by 30%.
    </strong>{" "}
    This is also the year where we tripled revenue.
