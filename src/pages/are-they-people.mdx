            A friend and
            <strong>I wanted to test out how adverts worked</strong>
            so we decided to make this website where you can rate a picture of an animal and decide if they think they are people or not. Once you vote, it loads a new image and you vote again.
            One boring weekend, we made it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The backend of the site is down, but
            <strong>
              you can still
              <a href="/are-they-people/index.htm" target="blank">
                interact with the front end prototype here
              </a>
              .
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>(it might act weird if you have ad blockers enabled)</p>

          <strong>I was in charge of the functionality</strong>
          and recruited a friend to turn my wireframes into final mockups. Once I was happy with the mockups, I then created the entire front end of the website. My project partner was in charge
          of all of the backend programming.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Here you can see the original wireframe and the first mockup.</strong></p>

          We learned how ads worked on websites, and

          Success!
