  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    You're about to dive into my experience at <a href="https://www.alida.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alida</a> (formerly Vision Critical), where <strong>my main task was to completely redesign their outdated platform.</strong>

  <p>
    Their original platform was{" "}
    <strong>Sparq, which was developed over the last 15 years</strong> to meet
    specific needs of specific companies for very specific tasks,{" "}
    <strong>and was never redesigned</strong> to include a broader audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    This led to a tool that was tailored to the needs of their existing (and highest paying)
    customers, but alienated new potential customers that were interested in the product.

  alt="An image of the old platform compared to the new one"

  <p>
    The goal was{" "}
    <strong>
      to create an updated version of the platform that kept the core
      functionality intact
    </strong>{" "}
    for our current user base, and adapted it enough{" "}
    <strong>to make it more accessible and welcoming for new users.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This new platform would be called Sparq Next Gen.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>
        With a core design team of about 7 UX Designers or varying skill levels, each one of us worked on a separate area of the
        product and with a separate product team.
    </strong>
  </p>

<p>
  We would reconvene several times a week to update each other on our progress,
  and coordinate cross-team features. We built and used a UI library to ensure our
  finished designs were consistent.
</p>

  <p>
    Oftentimes, <strong>
        we had to take extremely complex scenarios and break them down into new,
        more intuitive interactions and flows
    </strong>, sometimes even cutting features and functionality along the way.
  </p>

  alt2="The new, redesigned Condition Builder in Sparq Next Gen"

  <p>
    Essentially a complex filtering feature, <strong>the condition builder allowed our users to find the perfect customers to target</strong>. It was extremely convoluted, as it was designed to the needs of the few, highest paying
    users. <strong>I was in charge of adapting it to the needs of the majority of our userbase.</strong>
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>Here's what I did for this feature:</strong>. 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Understood what functions and features were most used via quantitative data analysis</li>
  <li>Understood the implications of keeping certain features while cutting others by interviewing clients</li>
  <li>Wireframed the flows, optimized for the most important use cases first</li>
  <li>Prioritized and adjusted the requirements after reviewing them with stakeholders and the dev team</li>
  <li>Mocked up the interfaces and <a href="https://invis.io/WV63QOVM2" target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer noopener">prototyped</a> the final flows, including all edge cases</li>
  <li>Conducted usability tests for early feedback before implimentation</li>
  <li>Created detailed <a
    href="https://invis.io/WV63QOVM2"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer noopener">functionality documents</a>, including viz specs, for the dev team</li>

  alt2="The new, redesigned Profile Variables feature that allowed for advanced functionality"

<p>
  Anytime someone responds to a personal question in a survey sent out by Sparq Next Gen, each
  response is collected and added to their profile. These <strong>bits of customer information are called Profile Variables. They can be later used by the condition builder to target specific people based on their personal information.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  In the original platform, users could only choose from a set list of Profile
  Variables to collect information. My goal was to update the functionality to include creating/editing/sorting/filtering/removing them. 
    
    adding empty states in the UI and addressing all of the edge cases that came
  with these features.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Here's what I did for this feature:</strong>. 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Understood the most used profile variables via quantitative data analysis</li>
  <li>Conducted research interviews to better understand the context</li>
  <li>Created the requirements for the feature</li>
  <li>Created wireframes and mockups for the flows</li>
  <li>Tested all of my designs using <a
    href="https://invis.io/V25ZZQY7B"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer noopener"
  >prototypes built in sketch and inVision.</a></li>

<p>
  On top of those larger tasks, I was also working on dozens of smaller ones. Resources were
  often tight at Vision Critical, so <strong>
      I would sometimes redesign features in phases so we could get something in front of our
      users sooner
  </strong>
  , without taking up too much dev time.
</p>

<p>
  The Dashboard is a good example of that. It was an obnoxious, bare screen at
  first, but I managed to increase satisfaction on it with a few tweaks pushed
  out over several iterations.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    Here you can see the first version of the dashboard that was launched right
    before I joined the company
  </strong>
  . That screenshot was from everything above the fold on a 13" macbook. <strong>
    Next you can see the proposed updated version.

<p>
  <strong>
      I tackled these smaller tasks with proper documentation and prototype testing whenever
      possible
  </strong> because, not only does it help communicate them to the dev team, it also helps solve
  creative arguments.
</p>

<p>
  This example is a small update that was required because
  <strong>we found our users were not using the "Close Date" feature</strong>, however,
  there were too many opinions on how it should be addressed, if at all.
</p>

<NextSteps title="Outcome">
  <p>
    It's hard to define a solid outcome on how my work affected the company's
    KPIs because it was continuously being updated and reiterated with several
    other features at once. Release cycles were also extremely long and there
    was not a lot of communication from the upper management team (who got to see
    the results). Either way,{" "}
    <strong>
      I learned a lot about working on a matrix UX team and how to balance a lot
      of projects at once.
