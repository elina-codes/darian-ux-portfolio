<WorkIntro>
<h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This was a chat application I was commissioned to design as <strong>an experiment to learn more about spending behaviour in mobile games.</strong>
  </p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Many games out there rely on a collection of different mechanics and dynamics in order to hook the player and get them to spend, but there wasn't enough information out there that could tell us what, in its simplest form, is the main reason (or reasons) as to why people will spend a lot of money in mobile games.
</p>

<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>
We believed that <strong>"status" was the main reason for spending</strong>, and that people will spend money to increase their status in games, and will spend a ridiculous amount in order to guard and keep that status.
</p>
  <p>
  If this was to be a true experiment, we needed to control the environment as much as possible. We needed to answer, "what is the least amount of 'game' that we can make, and that
    encourages people to spend money for their status?".

  <p>
    It's a simple chat application, but <strong>every time you send a message, it displays your name, your location, and your level. If you want to increase your level, you must pay a dollar</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Messages are posted in white text into the chat, but <strong>the top 1% of the users who have the highest level will have their message displayed in blue text</strong>. That's it. If someone bumps you out of the 1% by having a higher level than you, you lose the blue text on your messages. <strong>So the idea is that people that get bumped out of the 1% will then spend more to get back into the 1%.</strong>

  <p>
    Since this was a low-risk project, and meant to be a quick experiment, we agreed on a <strong>Lean UX approach</strong>. It did not require a lot of upfront research, but instead, the plan was to <strong>track usage and metrics after release to justify future iterations</strong>.
    </p>
  <p>Once the solution was locked down and requirements were agreed upon, the wireframes were done quickly using Balsamiq and reviewed with the client.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here you can see some of the wireframes I made.

  title="Mockups"

  alt="A few full mockups of the major screens in the 1 Percent."
>
  <p>
  Mockups went back and forth with the client until we agreed on the layout and styling.
  </p>
  <p>There were even a few extra screens that were created to hit the requirements, but in order to stay true to the Lean UX approach, we decided that we should reduce scope and release only what was necessary to prove our hypothesis, and revisit the additional screens if the data collected afterwards suggested we should.

  <p>
  <strong>While the backend was being worked on, I took this opportunity to teach myself everything else in the process of releasing and Android app to the world.</strong>, such as researched the submission process, learning how microtransactions work, legalalities, and the
    website splash page.

<NextSteps title="Outcome" subtitle="">
<p>
 The app itself was never completed, the client had plans on building it themself, as they are a programmer, but I guess life gets in the way sometimes. I would love to see it finished one day. The designs are done, so if you would like to see
  the rest of them, or want to build this yourself, just ask and I would be happy to share.
