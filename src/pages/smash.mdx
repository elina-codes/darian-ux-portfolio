    No longer on the app store, this was an iOS game that I worked on at <a href="http://athinkingape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Thinking Ape</a>. The goal of the game was to conquer rival S.M.A.S.H agents with your monster army while defending your city from their futile attacks.

  <h3>My role</h3>
  <p>
    As I was currently managing two other products at the time,<strong> I mainly served as a UX Consultant to the lead designer.</strong>

  <p>
    To assist the lead designer, <strong>I planned, conducted and reported on formal usability tests</strong>, then offered suggestions on how to fix the main issues.
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>
    Here you can see some examples of the first Usability Tests I ran on
    S.M.A.S.H.
  </strong>
</p>

<p>
  I encourage my team to watch these, as I like to do a formal debrief with them
  after where they get to highlight the top issues they found, then we
  brainstorm solutions right there.
</p>

<p>
  If there is not enough consistent feedback, and we cannot run more tests, then
  I report my observations on each screen to allow the team to decide on what is
  important.
</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Here you can find two of the Usability Test Reports for S.M.A.S.H.</strong> <a href={require("../files/smash-usability-test-01.pdf")} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This first report</a> is from the videos above, and <a href={require("../files/smash-usability-test-02.pdf")} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this second report</a> is after several months of iterations.

<NextSteps title="Outcome">
  <p>
    Though I didn't have my eye on the metrics, my personal win was that{" "}
    <strong>
      I showed several people the benefits of early testing for products with a
      lot of unknowns
    </strong>
    . This is proven by the fact that they had me do more testing for them
    several months later.
