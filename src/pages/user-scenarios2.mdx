<MethodSectionWhatIs method={currentMethod} title="What is a user scenario?">
  <p>
    In its simplest form, user scenarios are narratives created to show how users might act to achieve a goal. It’s important to note that user scenarios are not user stories.
    </p> 
<p>
  User scenarios are short narratives (they have a plot) that show a user using your product or service to achieve their goal. User scenarios dive into motivations, needs and barriers in the context of how your users would use your design, product, or feature. In short, scenarios detail out what users would likely experience as they proceed toward using an ideal solution.
</p>
<p>
User stories, on the other hand, are short, 1 sentence long, statements that describe a user’s goal and follow a very specific format (As a {type of user}, I want {some feature}, so that {reason}.) You can find more information on user stories here.
</p>
<p>
There are many benefits to writing user scenarios; they are a great tool to help your team identify user requirements, they help create tasks for your usability tests (link), align your team and stakeholders with a shared vision, and in the absence of hard data, they can be a good substitute when making decisions. User scenarios will ultimately help your team to better ideate and iterate on your product.

  title="How do you create a User Scenario?"
>
<ol>
<li>
  <h3>Step 1: Book a meeting with participants who feel they understand your users well.</h3>
  This could be with others at your company (like your product owners or members from the customer service team), or even actual users. Book as many people as you feel you can guide through a brainstorming session without it getting out of hand.
</li>

<li>
  <h3>Step 2: Conduct a brainstorming session</h3>
  <p>I find that good user scenarios are broken up into three distinct parts and your brainstorming session should be as well. Have your team spend 10 minutes on each part and generate as many ideas as possible.</p> 
  <p>Here are the three parts you can break your scenarios into, with questions to help focus your brainstorming session around:</p>

  <p><strong>Context and goal</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who is this person? (Existing personas will help here, but if you don’t have them, just do your best to define this person)</li>
    <li>What skills do they have or don’t have?</li>
    <li>What tools are they familiar with?</li>
    <li>Where are they when this scenario takes place?</li>
    <li>What are the circumstances leading up to this point?</li>
    <li>What are their goals? Why?</li>
  </ul>


  <p><strong>Problem and current process</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the problems they currently face? Why?</li>
    <li>What is their current process? Or how do they currently do things?</li>
    <li>What are the issues with this process?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>New process</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the steps they go through with this new process? Or how will they do things?</li>
    <li>How does this new process help them achieve their goals or solve their problems?</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>
  <h3>Step 3: Edit and clean them up</h3>
  <p> Once you have these ideas captured somewhere, you can either review and refine them with your team, or do so on your own. You may find it helpful to mix and match certain parts of the scenarios with others until you are satisfied you have enough solid scenarios to review with your team or lead product person.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <h3>Step 4: Prioritize them</h3>
  <p>It might be unreasonable to use every single scenario as a guide for your product, so now you must go through and prioritize which scenarios best represent your product and business goals. This is a great time to get your team involved again, as it will help you come to a team agreement on why you’re building this product and for whom.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <h3>Step 5: Document and share them</h3>
  <p>Make sure your final, prioritized scenarios are documented and shared with the rest of your company. Different departments will find different value in them.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<MethodSectionTips method={currentMethod} title="Tips for a great user scenario">
<ul>
  <li>
    Send these scenarios to some of your users and ask them if these scenarios make sense to them. Or better yet, use these scenarios as context for tasks in your usability tests, and at the end of each task, ask your participant if the scenario made sense to them or is something they often go through. The results from these tests will help reinforce their validity and get buy-in from other departments to use them.
