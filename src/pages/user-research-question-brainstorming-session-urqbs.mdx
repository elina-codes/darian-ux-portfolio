<MethodSectionWhatIs method={currentMethod} title="What is a URQBS? Booya">
  <p>
    URQBS is an acronym for User Research Question Brainstorming Session (pronounced erk-you-biss). This method is conducted by bringing together your stakeholders and as many members of your team, and having them brainstorm questions for your upcoming research interviews.
  </p>
  <p>
    This method is great for getting your team invested early on in the project because they are the ones that come up with the questions (which then get the responses, which create the designs, which finally turns into their tasks). So when it comes time for them to do their part on the project, they will have a deeper understanding of what they are doing and why.
  </p>
  <p>
    The URQBS is a great way to increase UX maturity, and is a growing term in the UX space (it’s pretty much the new “Fetch”).

<MethodSectionSteps method={currentMethod} title="How do you conduct a URQBS?">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1: Schedule a meeting</h3>
      <p>
        Try to invite as many people as possible that will be working on this project. If multiple departments will be involved, try to invite someone from each one. Different departments tend to have different perspectives, and unique questions to ask.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 2: Explain the project</h3>
      <p>
      When you have everyone together, you want to explain to them the background of the project. This will get them caught up to where you are, and allow everyone to start on the same page.
      </p>  
      <p>
      Go through the business goals this project is targeting, explain the problems that this project is trying to solve, and if you already have a potential solution in motion, explain that to. These may trigger more questions from the group.
      </p> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 3: Brainstorm Questions</h3>
      <p>
        Now is when everyone gets to write out their questions. You can use different types of brainstorming methods, as long as it generates a lot of questions. It may also help to ask them “What do you need to know about the user in order to proceed with confidence?”.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 4: Set up the space</h3>
      <p>Spread the cards out on a table in your testing area. If you’re doing a Closed Card Sort, write the name of each of your content categories on a different coloured index card and place them at the top of the table in a row. If you’re doing an Open Card Sort, keep those different coloured index cards blank. The participant will use these to create their own category labels later on.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 5: Conduct the session</h3>
      <p>
      Explain the Card Sort task to the participant, then ask them to describe their thoughts as they sort. This will allow you to understand their thoughts, rationale, and frustrations.
      </p>
      <p>Allow the participant to add a content card, eliminate a card, or change a label. This may reveal interesting insights.
      </p>
      <p>Plan about one hour for each session. Times will vary depending on the amount of information they have to sort, and Closed Card Sorts typically take less time than Open Card Sorts.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 6: Document the results</h3>
      <p>
        Take a photo of the table so you can compare the results easily with other users’ card sorts.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 7: Repeat the process with each participant</h3>
      <p>
        I suggest around 5-8 participants. This will allow you to find some consistency in which cards appeared together most often, or how often cards appeared in specific categories.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 8: Analyze the results</h3>
      <p>
        Take note of the patterns you found in the card results, and take note of the similar comments made by your participants. If such patterns do not emerge, it may mean that the content is too broad, or that the terminology used for the content is confusing to your participants.   
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 9: Share the takeaways</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, share the takeaways with your stakeholders and team.
      </p>
    </li>

<MethodSectionTips method={currentMethod} title="Tips for a great URQBS">
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you find the participant has created too many groups in your Open Card Sort, ask them if some of the groups could be combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Limit the number of cards to what’s appropriate for your goal and your timeframe.  I recommend 30 to 50 at the most. You can always adjust this slightly after each session.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can always do an Open Card Sort first to see how your content is grouped together and labeled, and a Closed Card Sort to validate those labels with another round of participants.
    </li>
