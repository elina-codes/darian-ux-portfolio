    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This was a platform built{" "}
      <strong>for people to selflessly help each other</strong>. It was
      designed to make it fun and easy for friends and neighbors to give and
      get help for anything, anywhere.
    </p>
    <h3>The problem</h3>
    <p>
      When I came on board, the devs had already built an MVP but were{" "}
      <strong>
        not seeing any traction at all. There was no clear vision from the
        CEO
      </strong>{" "}
      , and every dev in the company had an equal say in how the site should
      be designed and built. This resulted in a Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster
      of an MVP, with{" "}
      <strong>
        no flow, no informational hierarchy or prioritization, and an
        overwhelming amount of poorly thought-out features
      </strong>{" "}
      that meant nothing to their users.
    </p>
    <h3>My role</h3>
    <p>
      I was hired on as the Lead UX Designer,{" "}
      <strong>
        to redo the MVP and to get this product back on track.
      </strong>

  <p>
    <strong>This is what was built before I joined the company.</strong> It was
    designed and built by the programmers, and seemed to have no consistency,
    focus, or flow. They knew it needed some work, but did{" "}
    <strong>
      I started doing quick Usability Tests to show them the overwhelming,
      negative feedback
    </strong>{" "}
    , and that almost everything needed to change.
  </p>

      Here are some raw notes from one of my quick usability tests.
    </a>{" "}
  </p>
  <p>
    Once{" "}
    <strong>
      I proved to the team and CEO that there were some serious issues
    </strong>{" "}
    , there was immediate buy-in for UX.

  <p>
    After the results from the usability tests,{" "}
    <strong>I worked with the CEO to define the business goals.</strong> This
    presented an even greater challenge because he had not really defined them
    before, and he wanted to target two completely opposite audiences with the
    same features.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked with him and the team to come up with some targets to hit and some
    KPIs to start tracking.{" "}
    <strong>Then I had them create a new roadmap</strong> and we agreed on a
    deadline for the MVP of the new version of Otherly.
  </p>
  <p>We were really starting to feel like a team here.</p>

  <p>
    Since the goal of this project was to make it easier for people to
    selflessly help each other, I took a step back from the designs and{" "}
    <strong>
      I conducted more research on Altruism to find out what motivated people to
      help each other.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I shared these findings with my team and we brainstormed ideas on how we
    could use this knowledge in our designs.

  <p>
    With my knowledge on altruism and motivations,{" "}
    <strong>
      I then needed to lock down a preliminary target audience for our MVP.
    </strong>{" "}
    This would help us justify design decisions and give us a face to empathize
    with.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I conducted around 30 research interviews</strong> in order to
    determine if any patterns could be established in their answers to use{" "}
    <strong>to define our target audience.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    {" "}

  <p>
    From our interviews,{" "}
    <strong>
      we found some patterns in certain apps and sites that our users used on a
      daily basis.
    </strong>{" "}
    For our MVP, we knew we needed to get something out that would be easy to
    use for our users, so{" "}
    <strong>
      we incorporated common conventions from those apps and sites,
    </strong>{" "}
    as well as other apps I found in my comparative analysis.

    <strong>Here you can see some of the images I compared</strong> and how that
    translated into our final designs.

  <p>
    At this point, we were comfortable with the vision and direction of the
    product, so{" "}
    <strong>
      I then began wireframing the functionality for the mobile version.
    </strong>{" "}
    This allowed us to really consider what functionality we absolutely needed.
    and how we could enhance their experience with the full web app.

    <strong>
      We then ran tests on our mobile and web app wireframes and iterated over
      and over again
    </strong>{" "}
    until we were getting consistently good feedback. Once I was satisfied that
    we were getting the goal across with the functionality and{" "}
    <strong>
      I passed these off to the Interface Designer, so they could turn them into
      proper mockups.

      Here is a snapshot of the InVision prototype for the web app.

  <p>
    The Interface Designer then took the wireframes and gave back the first
    round of mockups for mobile.
  </p>
  <p>
    By this time, we were well on our way to the final product, but
    unfortunately, the company could not secure more funding and the product had
    to be put on hold.

<NextSteps>
  If I ever worked on this project again, my next steps would be to{" "}
  <strong>review the mockups</strong> with the ID, then constantly work{" "}
  <strong>reiterate them</strong> so the functionality and architecture remains
  intact. <strong>Usability Tests on a new prototype</strong> with these mockups
  would be conducted and, once satisfied with the feedback, the devs would then
  start building it while we worked on finalising the Web App.
