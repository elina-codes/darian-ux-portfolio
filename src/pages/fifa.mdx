    This was my first professional job in the industry. I was hired on by <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Arts</a> as a co-op student on the design team and was kept on after I finished University.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The main skills I learned</strong> on this project were how to <strong>rapidly iterate on wireframes</strong>, and how to properly <strong>communicate my designs.</strong>

      </a>
    </strong>, you can see the final mockup for the Team Central feature, as well as <strong>the level of detail I went into in order to communicate those designs</strong> to the rest of the team. The original document was 16 pages long but this should give you a good idea.

<p>
  I was never updated on what our KPIs were on these projects, so I don't really have a measurable outcome. I <strong>gained a lot of new knowledge, some professional experience, and a good start to my career.</strong>

    Joining near the end of production, and right before release, my tasks were repetitive but, coming from the Wii, a great intro into next gen development.
  </p>

  <h3>My Role</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>I helped out on the design and production team</strong> by writing new stories for career mode, setting up tournaments, and answering questions from the translation team in Spain.

  <p>
    <strong>One of my tasks was to write news stories for Career Mode</strong>, which were then translated into 16 different languages <strong>and made me the liaison with the Localization department in Spain.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I was also tasked with setting up some tournaments, which required a lot of research on football tournaments from around the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Here you can see a screenshot from Career Mode</strong> where you can see my tiny, tiny bit of story at the bottom-middle.

<NextSteps title="Outcome" subtitle="FIFA 11">
  <p>
    Though it was more filler tasks and not so much UX Design work, it was still a good experience. <strong>It landed me a spot on FIFA Ultimate Team where I really got to start diving deeper into UX Design</strong> for games.
