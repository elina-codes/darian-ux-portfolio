  <p>
    Party in my Dorm is a mobile game where you basically <strong>participate in campus activities to gain experience points, level up your character, and spend money to upgrade your dorm.</strong>

  <h3>My Role</h3>
  <p>
    Taking over <strong>as product lead, I created new features, designed new security measures, produced promotions, and more.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Below are some examples of my work.</p>

  <p><strong>Our users often fell victim to account fraud or hacking.</strong></p>

  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>I redesigned the registration system to limit the number of devices our users could use for one account.</strong> This required a new system of screens and edge cases for the user to link their account with our custom registration service, as well as through facebook, <strong>with rewards at every step of the way to encourage them to fully protect their account.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here you can see the <a href={require("../images/work/party-in-my-dorm-05.jpg")} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flow chart</a> and <a href={require("../images/work/party-in-my-dorm-06.jpg")} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wireframes</a> for the registration system.
  </p>

  <h3>Result</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>
      This resulted in an almost 50% drop of account related tickets being submitted to our Customer Service team.
    </strong>

    When I took over as product lead, I noticed that <strong>the feedback and metrics from our hardcore players suggested they wanted some new challenges</strong>, and were getting bored with our game. To make things worse, at the time we did not have the resources available to create entirely new features.
  </p>

  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>I introduced an entirely new difficulty level to the game with much bigger rewards.</strong> This was achieved by taking the existing content, duplicating it in our CMS, outsourcing some art work, and rebalancing the game stats in the backend.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Here you can see a few images of some different dorm rooms. They goal was to play the game until you collected all of the objects in these rooms.</strong> Each object would also boost your stats.
  </p>

  <h3>Result</h3>
  <p>
    The result was a huge! There was <strong>a steady increase in revenue, late game retention, and a lot of satisfied players.</strong> Best of all, it required no dev work to accomplish.

  <p>
    <strong>
      I would also organize events and promotions to keep our users engaged and happy.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked closely with the art department and copywriter to come up with fun rewards and events, sometimes working with outsourced art
    contractors, and would balance the rewards and stats before releasing it live.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Here you can see some of the Christmas Pugs (my favourites)</strong>
    that our users had to collect over the holiday season. This was the most popular challenge we had to date and resulted in doubling our
    revenue during the holiday season. People love pugs!

<NextSteps title="Outcome" subtitle="">
  <p>
    Every release there were wins and losses. Overall, <strong>the game kept generating more and more revenue</strong>, and is still a revenue stream at <a href="http://athinkingape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Thinking Ape.</a>
