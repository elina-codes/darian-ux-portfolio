              A/B Testing, or Split Testing, is a method of testing one change
              on a page to see how it performs compared to the original. The
              idea is that you change only one variable, then show these two
              versions to two similarly sized audiences and analyze which one
              performed better over a specific period of time (long enough to
              make accurate conclusions about your results).

              Common things to A/B test are the wording of a headline, the color
              or placement of a button, or an image on the page. It can be even
              larger, such as adding a tutorial flow to the page. The point is
              that your test has to be controled and limited to one thing you
              are measuring so you can compare the metrics against the original
              version, then keep the changes that have a positive impact. A/B
              tests are valuable to a business because they're low in cost but
              can be high in reward.
