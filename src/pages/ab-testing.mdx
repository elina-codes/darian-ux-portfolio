    <p>
      A/B Testing, or Split Testing, is a method of testing one change on a page
      to see how it performs compared to the original. The idea is that you
      change only one variable, then show these two versions to two similarly
      sized audiences and analyze which one performed better over a specific
      period of time (long enough to make accurate conclusions about your
      results).
    </p>
    <p>
      Common things to A/B test are the wording of a headline, the color or
      placement of a button, or an image on the page. It can be even larger,
      such as adding a tutorial flow to the page. The point is that your test
      has to be controled and limited to one thing you are measuring so you can
      compare the metrics against the original version, then keep the changes
      that have a positive impact. A/B tests are valuable to a business because
      they're low in cost but can be high in reward.
