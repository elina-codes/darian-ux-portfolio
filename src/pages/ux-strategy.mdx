  title="What is a UX Strategy?"
>
  <p>
    A UX Strategy is the tailored plan and approach for a site or product. This
    tailored plan consists of a carefully chosen collection of UX methods, put
    together in a specific order, and adjusted to fit user needs, technical
    constraints, and business goals. In short, it’s taking the UX methods listed
    on this site and putting them in order.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though that may sound easy, understanding which methods to include in a plan
    only comes after enough understanding of each method, resources, budgets,
    timelines, constraints, UX maturity at the company, and more. There is no
    one way to determine a UX Strategy, and each strategy may be different than
    the last, which is why it is a difficult method to pull off.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a lot of variables in forming the right UX Strategy, and a well
    thought-out UX Strategy will help guide a team through the product life
    cycle, with confidence that they are solving the right problems for their
    users and the company, and in the right order.

      <li>
        It all depends on the level of UX Maturity at the company. A company with a low UX Maturity may require 6 months to a year before they have the proper processes and infrastructure in
        place to determine, and act on, a UX Strategy.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1: Understand the business goals</h3>
      Meet with your Product Manager or whoever has the deepest understanding of
      the goals, and clarify them. Look for any evidence that the goals were created
      based on either data or assumptions. If the goals were created on assumptions,
      you may need to propose extra methods into your strategy to validate those
      assumptions.
      <br />
      <br /> <strong>You may want to ask questions like:</strong>
      <br />
      - What are the current goals?
      <br />
      - Which of these goals do we want to solve?
      <br />
      - Why are we prioritizing this goal over the others?
      <br />
      - How were the goals determined?
      <br />- What are the risks if we are wrong about the goals?
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 2: Understand the user needs</h3>
      You also need to understand if the user needs are based on data or assumptions,
      as this will change your proposed UX Strategy too. If user needs are based
      on assumptions, you may need to add extra UX methods into your strategy to
      validate those assumptions, or you may want to propose a Lean UX approach and
      validate them after.
      <br />
      <br /> <strong>Some questions you can ask are:</strong>
      <br />
      - How do we know these are user needs?
      <br />
      - What is the data that suggests this? Where can I find that data?
      <br />
      - Who determined these were user needs, and how?
      <br />- What are the risks if we are wrong about the user needs?
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 3: Understand the constraints</h3>
      Understanding your constraints like timeline, budget, resources, and technical
      limitations should help you refine the list of UX methods you add to your UX
      Strategy. If it’s a tight timeline, you may need to find the balance of UX
      methods that can be done quickly and that offer the biggest payoff. If your
      resources or budget is a constraint, you may need to focus on cheaper UX methods.
      Have a 30 minute meeting with the person that can help you understand these.
      That’s all you probably need.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 4: Assess your confidence and consequences of being wrong</h3>
      This is where the steps to creating a UX Strategy can get tricky and diverge.
      Your main goal at this point is to make sure you are focused on the right user
      problems and the right business goals, otherwise, any solutions you come up
      with afterwards have a higher risk of missing the mark.
      <br />
      <br /> <strong>So you may have to ask yourself:</strong>
      <br />
      - Do we have enough confidence in our user needs and business goals?
      <br />
      - Are we comfortable we can proceed, with confidence, through the identified
      constraints?
      <br />
      - What are the consequences if we are wrong?
      <br />
      <br />
      In general, <strong>if you are not very confident</strong>
      in the user needs and business goals, <strong>
        and the consequences of being wrong are high
      </strong>
      , then it is in your project’s best interest to apply some UX methods
      towards validating these user needs and business goals before you can
      figure out a proper solution. If that’s your case, jump to step 7, and
      create a strategy just for that. However, if you are confident in your
      user needs and business goals, you can continue to the next step.
      <br />
      <br />
      Another divergence would be <strong>if you are not confident</strong>
      in your needs and goals,{" "}
      <strong>and the consequences of being wrong are low</strong>. If that’s
      the case, you may wish to continue to the next step, and go for more of a
      Lean UX game plan that focuses on building something based on assumptions
      and validating it quickly after release.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 5: Brainstorm solutions</h3>
      Now it’s time to brainstorm solutions that can address those business goals
      and user needs, and also fit within your constraints. Now is a good time to
      get more people involved too. Work with your stakeholders, Product Manager,
      and team to brainstorm some solutions, and refine the ones that seem like the
      best fit.
      <br />
      <br />
      Do you have any data to support any of these ideas? If you don’t, consider
      adding some UX methods into your strategy to validate these possible
      solutions before deciding on any, or if the risks of being wrong are low,
      you may want to choose a solution and a more Lean UX approach and focus on
      validation after release.
      <br />
      <br />
      Some companies with a low UX Maturity level may come to the table with solutions
      already. That is fine, but you must do your due diligence to ensure that those
      solutions were generated based on data. If they were not, you need to understand
      the risks if those solutions are not the right ones.
      <br />
      <br /> <strong>Some questions you may want to ask are:</strong>
      <br />
      - How did you come up with these solutions?
      <br />- Where is the data that gave you these ideas?
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 6: Hypothesize</h3>
      Capture your solutions, user needs, and business goals in specific hypotheses.
      <br />
      <br /> <strong>For example:</strong>
      <br />
      We believe that adding new, in-app dashboards based on the data from our popular
      reports (solution) will allow our users to spend less time digging through
      thousands of rows of spreadsheet data and more easily find what they are looking
      for (user needs) which will increase our in-app engagement and retention metrics
      (business goals).
      <br />
      <br />
      You should aim to have a separate hypothesis for each solution, but some
      hypotheses may encompass one or more business goals or user needs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 7: Create your UX Strategy</h3>
      Now that you have your hypotheses, and you understand the risks of being wrong
      with any of your assumptions or solutions, you can finally (and confidently)
      choose which UX methods to include in your UX Strategy, and in what order.
      <br />
      <br />
      Factor in everything we have covered and select the UX methods that can
      feasibly be done within your timeline and that will reduce the most amount
      of risk going forward with your project. Put them in a list, along with
      the length of time it will take to complete each one.
      <br />
      <br />
      Remember, UX is all about empowering confident decisions in design. Some methods
      may be quick to do, but other, longer methods may lower your risk more and
      provide you and your stakeholders with more confidence.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 8: Review your UX Strategy and make adjustments</h3>
      Now that you have your proposed list and UX Strategy, review it with your stakeholders
      or Product Manager. You may have to make some trade-offs and adjustments, which
      is why you need a deep understanding of the pros and cons of each UX method
      you’re suggesting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 9: Start work on your plan</h3>
      Once you have finalized your list, you can now start at the top and work your
      way down. Good luck!
