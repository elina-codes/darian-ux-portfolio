  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p>
    Through strategic planning, <a href="https://getstat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STAT Search Analytics</a> had identified several problems that led to a list of company goals, including:
  <br></br>
  <br></br>
  <ul>
    <li>To increase customer satisfaction and retention</li>
    <li>To reduce support burden</li>
    <li>To have a new feature fleshed out and validated for the dev team to pick up when they need work</li>
    <li>To increase engagement in our app</li>
    <li>To increase adoption of our app</li>
    <li>Release features that provide unique value compared to our competitors</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Throughout our research projects, we noticed there was a recurring piece of unsolicited feedback; our clients wanted to know where their keywords were going when they changed rankings.
    </p>
  <p>
    For example, when they have 50 keywords in position 3 on Monday, and only 40 in position 3 on Tuesday, where did those 10 go? What position are those 10 in now?
  </p>
  <p>
    I surfaced this to our VP of Product, and we agreed that we needed more information and it warranted its own research project.

  <p>
    We conducted a User Research Question Brainstorming Session (URQBS) with a few people that were going to be working on this feature; a few devs, CS members and the product owner.
  </p>

<p>
  This gave us a list of questions about our users that wanted answered. We then edited and prioritized them, then determined the best way to get the answers (ex: some required research interviews, others required data pulls, etc…). 
</p>

<p>
  The goal was to figure out what we could answer in a reasonable amount of time, and how.

  <p>
    From there we got to work on getting a mix of qualitative data and quantitative data. We conducted Research Interviews and did a deeper dive into our support system to see what exactly was being said.
  </p>

<p>
   One of the interesting takeaways from our research interviews was that even though our participants wanted to see this in an interactive dashboard, they would still be happy if this information was only available in a report.
</p>
<p>
   From this, and the rest of the takeaways, we were able to create a list of requirements for v1 of this feature.
