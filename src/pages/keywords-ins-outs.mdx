    Their original platform was{" "}
    <strong>Sparq, which was developed over the last 15 years</strong> to meet
    specific needs of specific companies for very specific tasks,{" "}
    <strong>and was never redesigned</strong> to include a broader audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    This led to a tool that was tailored to the needs of their existing
    customers, which was great for retention, but{" "}
    <strong>poor for their adoption metrics.</strong>

  <p>
    The goal was{" "}
    <strong>
      to create an updated version of the platform that kept the core
      functionality intact
    </strong>{" "}
    for our current user base, and adapted it enough{" "}
    <strong>to make it more accessible and welcoming for new users.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This new platform would be called Sparq Next Gen.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>
        On a team of about 7 UX Designers, each one of us worked on a separate area of the
        product, with a separate product team and manager.
    </strong>
  </p>

<p>
  We would reconvene several times a week to update each other on our progress,
  and coordinate cross-team features. We used a UI library to ensure our
  finished designs were consistent.
</p>

  <p>
    Oftentimes, <strong>
        we had to take extremely complex scenarios and break them down into new,
        more intuitive interactions and flows
    </strong>, sometimes even cutting features and functionality along the way.

  alt2="The new, redesigned Condition Builder in Sparq Next Gen"

  <p>
    Essentially a complex filtering feature, <strong>the condition builder allowed our users to find the perfect customers to target</strong>. It was extremely convoluted, as it was designed to the needs of the few, highest paying
    users. <strong>I was in charge of adapting it to the needs of the majority of our userbase.</strong>
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>This wasn't just a facelift</strong>. This was understanding what
  functions and features were most used, and understanding the implications of
  keeping some, and cutting others.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    After analyzing the user data. I optimized it for the most important use
    cases first
  </strong>
  , and also cut certain options for it, as they were barely being used, or would
  take too long to build, and were only adding more confusion to the system.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    Here you can see some screenshots of the original and final version of the
    condition builder
  </strong>
  , as well as an <a

<p>
  Anytime someone responds to a personal question in a survey sent out by Sparq Next Gen, each
  response is collected and added to their profile. These <strong>bits of customer information are called Profile Variables. They can be later used by the condition builder to target specific people based on their personal information.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  In the original platform, users could only choose from a set list of Profile
  Variables to collect information.{" "}
  <strong>
    My job was to add functionality to the existing version of this
  </strong>
  , such as creating a new Profile Variable, editing/sorting/filtering them, removing
  them, adding empty states in the UI and addressing all of the edge cases that came
  with these features.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    I came up with the requirements from analyzing the results of our user
    research interviews. I tested all of my designs using prototypes built in
    sketch and inVision. I also wrote up functionality documents for all major
    updates to this feature.

<p>
  On top of those larger tasks, I was also working on dozens of smaller ones. Resources were
  often tight at Vision Critical, so <strong>
      I would sometimes redesign features in phases so we could get something in front of our
      users sooner
  </strong>
  , without taking up too much dev time.
</p>

<p>
  The Dashboard is a good example of that. It was an obnoxious, bare screen at
  first, but I managed to increase satisfaction on it with a few tweaks pushed
  out over several iterations.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    Here you can see the first version of the dashboard that was launched right
    before I joined the company

  . That screenshot was from everything above the fold on a 13" macbook. <strong>

<p>
  <strong>
      I tackled these smaller tasks with proper documentation and prototype testing whenever
      possible
  </strong> because, not only does it help communicate them to the dev team, it also helps solve
  creative arguments.
</p>

<p>
  This example is a small update that was required because
  <strong>we found our users were not using the "Close Date" feature</strong>, however,
  there were too many opinions on how it should be addressed, if at all.

<NextSteps title="Outcome">
  <p>
    It's hard to define a solid outcome on how my work affected the company's
    KPIs because it was continuously being updated and reiterated with several
    other features at once. Release cycles were also extremely long and there
    was not a lot of communication from the upper management team who got to see
    the affected numbers. Either way,{" "}
    <strong>
      I learned a lot about working on a large UX team and how to balance a lot
      of projects at once.
