  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p>
    Through strategic planning, <a href="https://getstat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STAT Search Analytics</a> had identified several problems that led to a list of company goals, including:
  <br></br>
  <br></br>
  <ul>
    <li>To increase customer satisfaction and retention</li>
    <li>To reduce support burden</li>
    <li>To have a new feature fleshed out and validated for the dev team to pick up when they need work</li>
    <li>To increase engagement in our app</li>
    <li>To increase adoption of our app</li>
    <li>Release features that provide unique value compared to our competitors</li>

  <p>
    Throughout our research projects, we noticed there was a recurring piece of unsolicited feedback; our clients wanted to know where their keywords were going when they changed rankings.
    </p>
  <p>
    For example, when they have 50 keywords in position 3 on Monday, and only 40 on Tuesday, where did those 10 go? What position are those 10 in now?

  <p>
    THIS IS ALL GOING TO CHAGE. JUST WORKING ON THIS ONE NOW. Essentially a complex filtering feature, <strong>the condition builder allowed our users to find the perfect customers to target</strong>. It was extremely convoluted, as it was designed to the needs of the few, highest paying
    users. <strong>I was in charge of adapting it to the needs of the majority of our userbase.</strong>
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>This wasn't just a facelift</strong>. This was understanding what
  functions and features were most used, and understanding the implications of
  keeping some, and cutting others.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    After analyzing the user data. I optimized it for the most important use
    cases first
  </strong>
  , and also cut certain options for it, as they were barely being used, or would
  take too long to build, and were only adding more confusion to the system.
